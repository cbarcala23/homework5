# Title
Chris Barcala's Work Day Scheduler - Homework Assignment 5

# About
This application will create a schedule of 9am-5pm for the given day all via Javascript/Jquery.   

# How it works
    1. The HTML Elements are all created dynamically within the script.js file on load.
    2. The user can then enter data into the schedule and click save for each hour.
    3. The data is stored in localstorage and will reappear even after a refresh of the page. Each Text Box has a unique ID set within a loop. These ID's are used to set values for each field.
    4. The rows are color labeled in the following fashion:
        - Grey: Past hours
        - Red: Current hour
        - Green: Future hours
